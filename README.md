This is a heavily modified version of the upstream [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) cuckoomon, provided under the GPL by Optiv.

32/64-bit compiled versions of this software are provided in our cuckoo-modified repository.
Please see that repository for more information on the changes to this edition of cuckoomon.

December 1st 2015 is my last day at Optiv.  I want to thank Optiv for giving me the opportunity to contribute all this work to the rest of the world.
Since I will no longer have access to this account, I have created a fork of each of the repos at https://github.com/spender-sandbox/ which you may
submit pull requests to that I will respond to quickly.
